      <div className="whatIsDCM-text">
          <p>
            Differentiated case management (DCM) is an approach used in various
            fields such as social work, child welfare, and criminal justice to
            manage and address cases or clients based on their individual needs
            and risk levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary goal of DCM is to allocate resources and services more
            effectively and efficiently by tailoring interventions to the
            specific circumstances and requirements of each case or client.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Principles and Components of DCM:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Assessment:</strong> DCM starts with a comprehensive
              assessment of each case or client, considering various factors
              such as needs, risk, and strengths.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Stratification:</strong> Cases are categorized into
              different risk levels to prioritize resources and interventions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tailored Interventions:</strong> DCM involves customizing
              interventions based on individual needs and risk levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regular Monitoring and Adjustment:</strong> Ongoing
              monitoring and adjustments ensure that interventions remain
              effective.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Resources are allocated
              efficiently to address the most pressing needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Collaboration between agencies and
              professionals ensures a coordinated approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data-Driven Decision-Making:</strong> Data and evidence
              inform decisions for optimization.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flexibility:</strong> DCM allows for adjustments as
              circumstances change over time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Differentiated case management can be applied in various contexts,
            including child welfare, criminal justice, healthcare, and social
            services, to provide more effective and targeted support to
            individuals and families.
